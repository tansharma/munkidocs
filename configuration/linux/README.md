## Setting up your munki_repo on Ubuntu and configuring munkireport-php

[Clayton Burlison](https://github.com/clburlison) has written a step-by-step guide for Ubuntu 14. The articles on his  [Blog](https://clburlison.com) will walk you trough setting up your munki_repo, configuring nginx and munkireport-php. You can find his articles here:

* [Setup a Munki repo on Ubuntu 14.04 - Part 1](https://clburlison.com/munkirepo-guide-part-1/)
* [Setup Mandrill on Ubuntu 14.04 - Part 2](https://clburlison.com/munkirepo-guide-part-2/)
* [Setup Munkireport on Ubuntu 14.04 - Part 3](https://clburlison.com/munkirepo-guide-part-3/)

> In principal our setup follows steps highlighted in Clayton's writeup, however we have adapted some of the steps mentioned in Clayton's tutorial to match our specific requirements
> The [ubuntu_munki](ubuntu_munki.sh) script should help configure nginx, samba and the munki_repo on your **Ubuntu** server. It will also download munkireport-php. You'll still need to download and configure MySQL and the config.php file for munkireport-php in order to get everything to work.

Changes we've had to make to match our environment needs
> *  Add relevant ports to **iptables**: In my current environment firewall rules are maintained by Puppet. As such, port 80 is restricted by default
> *  Creating a local user on the server that will administer Munki: User accounts are created on the machine and bound to AD by puppet. So we need a local admin account that multiple Admins can use. Alternatively you could add all Admin accounts to the machine and associate them with the **munki group**.
> *  Configuring Samba & defining the 'Default' config for Nginx: Although you can edit the options within the script to setup your samba volume, I've ended up doing this via a puppet module.
